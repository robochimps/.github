# Robochimps ![]()

We are a group of researchers exploring the fields of **molecular physics**, **spectroscopy**, and **theoretical chemistry**.
Some of us do this in universities, others in our spare time.
Our goal isn't just to publish papers, we want to share the code, tools, and computational tricks we use to get our results, so others can build on them and test them.
We believe science should be open and reproducible, and we're here to push the limits of what's computationally possible.

## Our  projects
### [vibrojet](https://github.com/robochimps/vibrojet) - A Python package built on **JAX**, for computing **kinetic** and **potential energy operators** of molecules and their **Taylor series expansions**.
### [rotational_clusters](https://github.com/robochimps/rotational_clusters) - A repository containing code for computing highly-excited rovibrational states of a triatomic molecule, including nuclear-spin hyperfine effects.
As an example, for the $\text{H}_2\text{S}$ molecule, we explore the effect of rotational energy-level clustering at high rotational excitations, a phenomenon linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by centrifugal distortion and Coriolis couplings.
### [flows](https://github.com/robochimps/flows) - A variational framework for computing vibrational and rovibrational states of molecules, leveraging **normalizing flows** for optimizing molecular basis sets.
